# Big Data Distributions and Ecosystems

This repository contains the presentation **“Big Data Distributions and Ecosystems”**, covering the evolution of big data platforms, major enterprise distributions, and the modern processing ecosystem built around Hadoop, Spark, and related technologies.

## 📌 Overview
The presentation explains how big data moved from raw Apache components to full enterprise platforms, highlighting:

- Why enterprise big data distributions exist  
- Challenges of managing large-scale Hadoop/Spark environments  
- Comparison of major distributions (Cloudera CDP, Hortonworks/IBM ODP, Cloud-native services)  
- Architecture and management differences  
- Ecosystem layers: storage, processing, orchestration, SQL engines, and streaming frameworks  

It is designed for academic oral exams and technical presentations.

## 🧩 Topics Covered

### 1. Why Big Data Distributions?
- Complexity of raw Apache projects  
- Need for integration, security, and support  
- Enterprise features: SDX, Ambari, cloud consoles  

### 2. Major Distributions
- **Cloudera CDP**  
- **Hortonworks HDP / IBM ODP**  
- **Cloud-native platforms:** AWS EMR, GCP Dataproc, Azure HDInsight  

### 3. Core Architecture Components
- HDFS – distributed storage  
- YARN – resource manager (the “cluster OS”)  
- Spark & MapReduce – batch processing  
- Hive & Spark SQL – interactive SQL  
- Storm, Spark Streaming, Flink – real-time engines  

### 4. Modern Big Data Ecosystem
- Multi-engine coexistence  
- Layered architecture: storage → orchestration → processing  
- Shift toward cloud-native big data  
- Data Lakehouse trends (Delta, Iceberg)  
- Kubernetes as a new orchestrator
